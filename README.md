**Project Name**: **TasklyInsight**

**Overview**:  
TasklyInsight is a modern Java showcase application that combines a task management system with a system analysis module (`Who-I-Am`) and performance testing capabilities. It demonstrates the use of cutting-edge Java features and technologies, including Spring Boot and Vaadin, to create a feature-rich and interactive web application. The application is powered by an H2 in-memory database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

### Key Features

1. **Task Management Module**:
   - Create, update, delete, and view tasks.
   - Track task statuses (e.g., Open, In Progress, Completed).
   - Set priorities and due dates for tasks.
   - Modern UI for task interaction with Vaadin.

2. **Who-I-Am Module**:
   - Analyze the local system (e.g., OS, CPU, memory).
   - Display key system metrics such as available processors, free memory, and architecture.
   - Provide insights into system performance.

3. **Performance Testing Module**:
   - Run predefined performance tests (e.g., database queries, API calls).
   - Visualize results with charts and statistics.
   - Measure response times and resource utilization.
